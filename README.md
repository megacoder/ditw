Do it this way -- encapsulate shell commands into a script(1) session for dummies(tm)

Motive
------

1) Wrap shell commands in appropriate script(1) package.
2) Always use absolute paths for commands as "root".
3) Never use absolute paths as a normal user.
4) Compress the resulting script in a form suitable for uploads.
