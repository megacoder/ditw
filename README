   Do it this way -- encapsulate shell commands into a script(1) session
   for dummies(tm)

Motive

     * Wrap shell commands in appropriate script(1) package.
     * Always use absolute paths for commands as "root".
     * Never use absolute paths as a normal user.
     * Compress the resulting script in a form suitable for uploads.
